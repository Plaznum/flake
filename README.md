flake
I'm just putting up the flakes that i use and actually updating them now i think

organized by device (for now)
test - vm sandbox (on only shisa so far)
shisa - desktop. general use
metaton - lenovo laptop. general use
shureimon (pending) - headless lappy 4 gateway/vlan/vpn (depends on pi-hole ease on nixos)

TODO turn all base configs/dotfiles that i use to H-M configs
TODO mutually accessable modules/configs
TODO ^^^ combine all flake.nix to one after this ^^^
TODO make 'base' desktop template (with and without pandy as user?)
